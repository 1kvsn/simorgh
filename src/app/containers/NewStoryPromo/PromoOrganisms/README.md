All the PromoTypes. If a stlye is not in line with what the Promo wants, we do styled(Promo.element)

In thes files we either return a single Promo or a promoList. This will depend from the number of items passed by the Controller. Even if this logic would be convinient to be here, maybe it is better to have this in the outer index.jsx aka: controller?
